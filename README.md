  The movie project is a search application designed for convenient movie discovery. The application not only allows users to quickly find a specific film but also provides a list of popular movies of the week. 
  Through the app, users can access comprehensive information about any movie, including ratings and reviews. Leveraging the themoviedb.org database, the program ensures up-to-date and detailed information. 
  Developed using React.js, the application seamlessly combines efficiency and aesthetics to cater to the needs of every movie enthusiast.
