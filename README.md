Hi there, my name's Roman and I'm interested in creating impressive and effective web interfaces.👨‍💻 

### About me:

I am a beginner web developer. My journey in it started with a free 7-day marathon where I created my first resume site. I liked it, 
     I signed up for a full 6-month course (full stack) from November 2022 to June 2023. In the course I studied web development. 
     Now that I've finished the courses, I want to join a team where I can be useful and develop my skills! My English level - intermediate

  🌱 I completed 6 month courses from GO IT school (full-stack developer)    

  🔭 An additional course from the SoftServe school (HTML, CSS, JS basic)     

 ⚡ In the past, I was a trainer of oriental martial arts
